# CPP_RPG
This is a prototype of a RPG game made in C++ with SDL.

For now I only uploaded the code portion but I think it is pretty easy to understand. Each object has its own file and even if there are many files most of the code is reusable so you can easily start from this code to make your own game or you can take parts of it that you want to reuse in your project. This code is still a prototype of a RPG game (it runs it is playable but pretty empty). it can still be optimized but once you know how it works it is very easy to use. Most of the objects are created in the file Scenes.h and most of the methods are called in the file Scenes.c that contains all the different scenes of the game. The files are almost all following the same schema, they always have the 3 following methods: init, update and draw. In init the variables are initialized, in update the variables are changed and in draw the object is being displayed. I tried to follow the most used convention but there might still have some inconsistency in my code.
